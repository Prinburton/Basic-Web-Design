        <h3>2. Single-Level Living for Accessibility</h3>

        <h3>3. Outdoor Connection</h3>

        <h3>4. Versatility and Customization</h3>
            <p>Ranch homes are incredibly versatile. 
                From the number of bedrooms to the design of your kitchen, ranch homes offer countless ways to make the space your own.
